# Face Blur with OpenCV

Welcome to the Face Blur project using the OpenCV library. This repository contains Python code for a face blurring application, allowing you to protect the privacy of individuals in images and live videos.

## Overview

The Face Blur project demonstrates how to use the OpenCV library to automatically detect and blur faces in images or video streams. This is a valuable technique for anonymizing individuals or sensitive information while preserving the rest of the content.

## Features

- **Automatic Face Detection**: The code utilizes OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier to locate faces within images and videos.

- **Flexible Blur Options**: Customize the degree of face blur to balance privacy and image quality.

- **Efficient Processing**: Efficiently blur faces even in real-time video streams.

## Getting Started

To start using this face blur tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using.
2. Run the code in a Python supported environment.
